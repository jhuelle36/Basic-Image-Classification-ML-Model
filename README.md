# Basic-Image-Classification-ML-Model
This code, uses TensorFlow, to train a neural network model to classify images of clothing. It takes in a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images and uses 60,000 to train and 10,000 to test the model's efficiency. The model created is a deep learning neural network model containing 3 layers. These layers contain an input, hidden(128 neurons), and output(10 neurons) layer. I learned how to create this model using TensorFlow tutorials with Keras.
