# Basic-Image-Classification-ML-Model
This code, uses TensorFlow, to train a neural network model to classify images of clothing. It takes in a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images and uses 60,000 to train and 10,000 to test the model's efficiency. I learned how to create this model using TensorFlow tutorials with Keras. The model created is a deep-learning neural network model containing 3 layers:

- Flatten: Input layer
- Dense: Hidden layer(128 neurons)
- Dense: Output layer(10 neurons)

Overall Accuracy: % 88.27
